 - implemented inventory.h and inventory.cpp to provide an interface like logic between PC and items (easier for me to envision)
 - implemented iList() in ui.cpp to display inventory and provide functionality for commands that utilize the inventory
		these commands consisted of expunge, inspect, equip, drop, and pick up (see README)
 - changed Yuxiang's method of UI::printEquipmentSlots() to implement the equipment logic and provide a visual interface so the player can see the symbol of each equipped item, and provide a 
		place for the functionality to un-equip items (see README)
